Most of these come from a timelong before Germany became a united nation-state in 1871 under Otto von Bismarck. Indeed, it was the historic disunity of Germany that led it to accrue so many different names.

Bright Side has found an&amp;nbsp;explanation for such measures against popular animated movies.
12. Peppa Pig
Banned in: Australia.
Reason: Teaches children not to&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;afraid of&amp;nbsp;dangerous insects.
Measures: Episodes are banned on&amp;nbsp;TV throughout the country.
This cute cartoon was banned after an&amp;nbsp;episode where the pigs started to&amp;nbsp;live with a&amp;nbsp;spider. This episode teaches the world to&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;friendly to&amp;nbsp;bugs, but for Australia, where more than 10,000 species of&amp;nbsp;spiders (some poisonous) live, such advice is&amp;nbsp;pretty dangerous.</description></item><item><title>15 Red Flags That Could Mean Your Partner Is Trying to Destroy Your Self-Esteem</title><link>/15-red-flags-that-could-mean-your-partner-is-trying-to-destroy-your-self-esteem-799823.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 26 Aug 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/15-red-flags-that-could-mean-your-partner-is-trying-to-destroy-your-self-esteem-799823.html</guid><description>Self-esteem and self-confidence are different things according to&amp;nbsp;psychologists.

In&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;relationship, our self-esteem may be&amp;nbsp;influenced by&amp;nbsp;our partner, and they can have a&amp;nbsp;hand in&amp;nbsp;both destroying it&amp;nbsp;and increasing it&amp;nbsp;for&amp;nbsp;us.

For example, they all agree that the first thing you should do&amp;nbsp;in&amp;nbsp;the morning is&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;eat a&amp;nbsp;frog. This means that it’s better to&amp;nbsp;deal with the worst thing in&amp;nbsp;your to-do list right after waking&amp;nbsp;up. Among other features of&amp;nbsp;their daily routine, there’s usually a&amp;nbsp;well-balanced and strictly organized daily schedule that helps them thrive in&amp;nbsp;both their careers and personal lives.

To&amp;nbsp;make sure he’s capable of&amp;nbsp;emotional intimacy, women often want to&amp;nbsp;examine their man’s behavior toward his mother. There is&amp;nbsp;no&amp;nbsp;doubt that a&amp;nbsp;boy who nurtures a&amp;nbsp;close bond with his mother grows up&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;be&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;stable and confident man.
A&amp;nbsp;relationship with their mother determines attachment style.
One study shows a&amp;nbsp;connection between mother and child behaviors.

Of&amp;nbsp;that, 3.75 million married couples were in&amp;nbsp;a&amp;nbsp;long-distance relationship.

However, sometimes apologies aren’t as&amp;nbsp;sincere as&amp;nbsp;we&amp;nbsp;tend to&amp;nbsp;think they are. Saying sorry and not really meaning it&amp;nbsp;is&amp;nbsp;the same as&amp;nbsp;lying. And when someone makes the statement, “I’m sorry,” but doesn’t take responsibility for their misdeed, it’s called a&amp;nbsp;“non-apology apology.”
We&amp;nbsp;at&amp;nbsp;Bright Side grew interested in&amp;nbsp;this matter and decided to&amp;nbsp;look at&amp;nbsp;some examples of&amp;nbsp;situations that we&amp;nbsp;regularly encounter in&amp;nbsp;our own lives.
