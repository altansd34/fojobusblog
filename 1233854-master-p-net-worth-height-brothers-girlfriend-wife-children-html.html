He was born in New Orleans, where he was raised in the area of Calliope Projects. He was the oldest sibling out of five. Percy attended two schools: Booker T. Washington High School and Warren Easton High School. During his time studying, Percy also found time to play as a member of a basketball team, and he was so talented that he managed to get an athletic scholarship at the University of Houston. However, he decided to drop out of this educational institution during his freshman year.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/27d21de417f49348.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Ryan Garcia: Facts about his boxing career, age, family, and net worth</span></p></a><p class=align-left>He continued his education at the Merritt College in Oakland, California, where he chose a business administration major. After his grandfather passed away, Percy inherited $10,000 and decided to put this money to good use. The young man opened a record store of his own, which he gave a name "No Limit Records". The store was situated in Richmond, California, and eventually, it became a base for Percy's record label. In 1990, the aspiring rapper released his first cassette tape "Mind of a Psychopath", and since then his music career kicked off.</p><p class=align-left>The debut album of Master P, which was titled "Get Away Clean" was released in February 1991. Inspired by his instant success, he started working on his second album, "Mama's Bad Boy", which was quickly completed and released in 1992. In-A-Minute Records was the studio which helped the young artist to release both of these tapes. Master P did not waste any time after their release and collaborated on the album together with the TRU Group. The title of this collaboration was "Who's da Killer?". In 1994, the artist produced the third album "The Ghettos Tryin to Kill Me!", which also became successful like the previous two. He also decided to release a compilation of No Limit songs, which resulted into two new albums. "99 Ways to Die" was the next work of Master P in 1995. Shortly after, he joined forces with TRU again, working on the album "True". It did very successfully on the charts, reaching high spots on many of them. The most famous song on this album was "I'm Bout' It, Bout It". During this year, Master P had no rest: he was also involved in the production of another compilation album.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/4ed093bf2e2a6d57.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>All the exciting details about Chad Michael Murray: His age, career, net worth and more</span></p></a><p class=align-left>There was a funny story connected with Master P. He confessed that in the early 1990s when he used to be an opening act for Tupac Shakur, he always confused the people who had to introduce him. They would call him "Mr P, the country singer", when in fact he was hip-hop and rap artist. They also were surprised that there are rappers from New Orleans because at the time there was a common misconception that all the rappers are from Los Angeles or New York, and in New Orleans, there are only blues and country artists. However, Master P remembered this story with humour and said that no matter what, the opening acts for Tupac brought him a lot of fans.</p><p class=align-left>1995 was the year when Master P made a decision to relocate his "No Limit Records" company because he wanted to attract some new potentially good artists. He moved the company from California to his native New Orleans. A year later, he released the fifth studio album, titled "Ice Cream Man". This was a significant move for him because the album contained a hit song "Mr Ice Cream Man", which brought the musician to the game. Eventually, he came back to working with TRU and started his work on "Tru 2 da Game", their fourth album, together with them. Even though this group used to consist of many singers, Master P decided to reduce it to a trio containing himself and his brothers, C-Murder and Silkk the Shocker. Master P's breakthrough album, called "Ghetto D", saw the world in 1997. During the very first week, the album sold more than 761 thousand copies, which was the highest that the musician ever got. This album went on to become triple platinum, and for Master P, this was the highest recognition.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/73bb92e02cbf2336.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>A quick look at the amazing life of Patrick Duffy</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Moreover, the super-hit "Make 'Em Say Uhh!" did incredibly well in the charts. The singer even got an honourable nomination for "Best Rap Video" at the MTV Video Music Awards, which he lost to Will Smith's work.</p><p class=align-left>Even though Master P's previous album sold plenty of copies and became platinum, he felt like his best work has still not been made. That is why he released "MP Da Last Don", his seventh album, in June 1998. This song compilation has become his best, as it made the debut on the prestigious Billboard Top 200 charts from the first place, and sold more than four million copies in general. As if this success was not enough, he released another album only one year later, which was called "Only God Can Judge Me". One of the most memorable songs from this album was "Step To Dis". This work ended up getting a gold status. The next thing he went to work on was the joint album with TRU, titled "Da Crime Family", which came out the same year, in 1999. Not so long afterwards, his ninth album "Ghetto Postage" came out. There were some legendary hit songs on it, such as "Souljas" and "Bout Dat". This hardworking rapper always wanted to make more and more music, as he created a new group "504 Boyz" and released the debut album called "Goodfellas" with them the same year. The rap enthusiasts might remember this group for getting the number one album in Top R&B/Hip-Hop Album chart and for their prominent single "Wobble Wobble".</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/e4a923098f27b437.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Cillian Murphy’s bio: family, net worth, age, latest news, Oppenheimer</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The tenth album of Master P, named "Game Face", was released in 2001. This was the first work that the rapper released on the new "No Limit", that was partnered with the Universal Music Group. Next year was sacrificed to working together with 504 Boyz on their second album "Ballers", which was another success. However, not long afterwards the problems began: the "No Limit" record company started losing popularity and got some lawsuits filed against them. As a result, they became bankrupt and had to close the company in 2003. Master P, however, did not just sit down there: he was simultaneously working on the eleventh album "Good Side, Bad Side", which he released through the Koch Records company. It became first on the Billboard chart "Independent Albums". Except that, he also worked on the album "The Truth" together with his TRU group, which was their last. Along with that, in 2005 Master P released the twelfth album "Ghetto Bill Vol. 1".</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-legit.akamaized.net/images/1a71cd5c4e79cc16.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>The lively biography of the ambitious and handsome Simon Halls</span></p></a><p class=align-left>The musician never gave up on his wish to recreate a label, so much that in 2005 he founded "Guttar Music" together with his son, Romeo Miller.

He also did not forget about his work with 504 Boyz, as they released the album dedicated to Hurricane Katrina, which became their last. 2006 and 2007 were also productive years for Master P, as he released the compilation "America's Most Loved Bad Guy" and the collaboration with his son Romeo "Hip Hop History". After many productive years, he finally took a break until 2010, when he was ready to get back to work. He spent this time without releasing songs or albums, just spending time with his family and renewing his energy.</p><p class=align-left>In 2010, Master P went on tour with his brother Silkk and son Romeo, which they labelled "No Limit Forever International". He continued collaborating with well-known artists, such as the rapper Gucci Mane, with whom he released a track "Brinks". He also had a few public performances. Along with this, he was working hard on re-branding his "No Limit" label by bringing new forces in there. In 2012, he started working on the thirteenth album. As a promotion for its release, he put out the official mixtape "Al Capone" and a collaboration mixtape "New World Order" with the new group "Louie V.

He started producing the group "Money Mafia", and released a few collaborations together with them. That was not all for the fans: inspired by the success of "Ice Cream Man 2", Master P decided to record and release two more sequels to this album.
