Invite her to events, too but do not make it look like a date. Your friends can also invite her to events on your behalf, or you can show up at any occasion she is attending if it is open for everyone.</p><h4 id=1083632-4-prove-you-are-a-reliable-friend class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>4. Prove you are a reliable friend</h4><p class=align-left>Keep the communication flowing and help her when she needs you. Compliment her and give her little gifts if you can afford them.

He stated:</p>You can only get to some ladies through the same door. So you must know which of the door works for the particular lady of your interests. Once you discover what moves her heart, invest in that spot continuously, and you will notice that the more you get her attention, the more your confidence builds.<p class=align-left>Dr. Sam suggested that men exude positive lyrical vibes to captivate a lady's attention when introducing conversation topics. He emphasized that incorporating charisma through speech or actions is a seamless way to consistently win a place in the lady's heart. The expert said:</p>While investing many emotions, you must display your charisma, friendliness, and positive gestures towards her that will make her very comfortable around you.
