Losing you was the worst thing that ever happened to me.</li><li>After saying goodbye, I felt like throwing myself into an endless pit to see eternal emptiness. Right now, I’m far too good to escape into the world of darkness. I hope you are happy wherever you are.</li><li>In my head, we’re still together. In my imagination, I can still touch your skin. In my dreams, I still get visions of you. In truth, I’m lost without you.</li><li>My eyes are hurting cause I can’t see you, My arms are empty cause I can’t hold you, My lips are cold cause I can’t kiss you, My heart is broken, and I miss you!</li><li>I wish you the best in life, knowing that you will one day understand the value of being close to others and the agony of being apart. Nothing can ever take your place in my heart.</li><li>The pain in my heart makes me appreciate the value of true happiness. Your leaving has changed my life.</li><li>I had dreams for us; I conjured up beautiful imaginations of our forever together. But reality has dawned on me; I guess we are good apart. Hoping my dreams are fulfilled elsewhere.</li><li>Promise me you will not forget the love we shared, the silly jokes, the romantic moments and all we did together. You are gone now, but never to be forgotten.</li><li>Living a day without you would mean having no life at all. But if losing you is the best thing to make you happy, then I must live without a life.</li><li>You made me fulfilled, but now I am all alone without you. I am broken, and I don’t know how to get over this.</li><li>I honestly cared for you more than myself. I forgot to love myself, and that’s where everything went wrong. Now, I will try to be happy no matter what.</li><li>Did we have to end what we shared? Did we have to let go of each other? What is the meaning of life if I don’t have you by my side?</li><li>You broke my heart, but I still feel like I would give this another shot because I can never get to love someone as much as I love you.</li><li>It’s so hard to forget pain, but it’s even harder to remember sweetness. You have no scar to show for happiness. You learn so little from peace.</li><li>I’ve never been this scared and confused. The thought of living without you is daunting. I hope that one day, I will find closure and move on completely. I feel sorry for myself.</li><li>We held hands, we kissed, we showed each other true love. Where did we go wrong? What happened to us? Why am I crying?</li><li>The saddest thing is when you are feeling really down, you look around and realise that there is no shoulder for you.</li><li>Sometimes giving someone a second chance is like giving them another bullet for their gun because they missed you the first time.</li><li>People told me to forget you, but I was stupid enough to hold on. But I have learned that you can’t hold onto someone who doesn’t wish to stay.</li><li>Please live a happy life. You told me that you couldn't be happy with me.
